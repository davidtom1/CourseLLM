# CourseLLM
A course project (Sem a 2026 @ BGU-CS) for the "LLMs for SE" Course.

The project provides an environment to enhance learning and teaching a CS course from a typical CS degree curriculum (e.g., Intro to Programming, Data Structures, Algorithms, Programming Languages, Operating Systems, Compilers, Probabilities...) using GenAI technologies.

It enables teachers to publish teaching material (markdown, DOC, PDF, code repositories) about the course.
Teachers also define learning objectives, skills, and learning trajectories together with assessment tools.

Students register to the published course and can:
- Chat about the published content according to their personalized learning paths.
- Perform personalized assessment activities (quiz, exercises)

Teachers obtain specific or synthetic reports on the performance of students as they interact with the course over the semester and based on this information, update the content or their teaching interventions.
